What are the controls to your game? How do we play? The controls are W and S to move back and forth and A and D to look side by side. You use the mouse to interact with any forms of UI. 

What creative additions did you make? How can we find them? The turn based combat script, in my eyes, is really cool and I feel very proud about how that turned out. It was a concept that I kinda just learned as I
worked on it and I am very happy about the result. 

Any assets used that you didn't create yourself?

Did you receive help from anyone outside this class?
Besides a couple youtube videos, I did not recieve help from anyone outside of class. 

Did you get help from any AI Code Assistants?
I used AI to try to help me debug one of the more promonent errors in the code, while it didn't help as much as I wanted, I did use it. 

Did you get help from any online websites, videos, or tutorials?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQNZwcd6FaY   For health bars and at the beggining of my work, I watched a very general video but it didn't impact my project and I can't find it now. 

What trouble did you have with this project?
The turn based combat was a pain, de-bugging every time I added a new feature, because nearly every feature had to be incorperated into the turn based combat script. Bug directly related to the combat were also
difficult to manage because it was complex and required coherence throughout the whole code. I also had trouble with colliders but than realized that the issue was my movement method. 

Is there anything else we should know? I hope you have fun and reach out if there are any further questions!
